# Buyma Insider

## SETUP

- Unicorn in development can be run with local launch command
- Nginx has to be setup in production, but locally
  unicorn is directly listening on port 5000 and
  localhost, so nginx don't have to be setup
- Daemonize command option is not added for unicorn, but
  could be if needed, just modify Procfile
- Make sure to set the ENVIRONMENT variable when running elsewhere
```
# Start rethinkdb with docker
docker run  --name rethinkdb -p 8080:8080 -p 28015:28015 --rm greyarch/rethinkdb

# Launching unicorn locally
ENVIRONMENT=development be unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb -E $ENVIRONMENT -d --host localhost --port 5000

# Launching pry
ENVIRONMENT=development be pry -Iapp:config:db -r 'buyma_insider'
```

## NOTE

- Use be ruby to run patches instead of pry, pry screws up sometimes the format
